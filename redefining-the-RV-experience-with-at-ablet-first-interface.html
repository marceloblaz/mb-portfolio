                        <h2>The problem in a nutshell</h2>
                        <p>Lightship is building the first all-electric, aerodynamic RV designed for the EV era. More
                            than a camper, it's a smart, self-powered home on wheels — redefining how people travel,
                            live, and interact with their environment.</p>

                        <p>I contributed to the design of Lightship's tablet-based interface, which serves as the
                            central control panel for the vehicle — managing everything from lighting to energy usage to
                            climate control. I worked closely with the design lead, developers, engineers, and external
                            partners to bring this experience to life.</p>

                        <h2>Impact</h2>
                        <p>The goal of the project was to design and prototype the tablet interface that would be demoed in Lightship’s first public reveal at SXSW 2023. The result was a tablet-native control system that allowed users to monitor and manage all major RV systems — from lighting and climate to energy and window tint — with real-time feedback and a clear, modern interface.</p>

                        <p>This prototype was showcased during SXSW 2023, where visitors interacted with the system in a
                            fully functional Lightship L1 unit. The launch generated strong media coverage and
                            enthusiastic responses from both the public and the press. The Lightship L1 was <a

                                rel="noopener noreferrer">nominated as a finalist in the SXSW Innovation Awards</a>,
                            spotlighting its unique blend of engineering, design, and sustainability.</p>

                        <h2>My Approach</h2>
                        <strong>Understanding the context</strong>
                        <p>At the start of the project, neither I nor the other designer had direct experience with RVs. To quickly close this gap, we set up a one-hour interview with a team member who owned a traditional RV. During a Zoom call, they gave us a virtual walkthrough of their vehicle — showing us firsthand how typical RV controls worked and what using them was actually like.</p>
                        <p>This session helped us understand the limitations of existing systems, from scattered physical switches to inconsistent labeling and feedback. It also gave us a clearer sense of user expectations, mental models, and opportunities to reimagine the experience through a more integrated, responsive interface.</p>

                        </div>
                        <strong>Collaborative research and iteration</strong>
                        <p>We followed that with a working session alongside the client’s engineering and product leads to define and cluster feature areas — energy, climate, lighting, setup, and more. The output was a shared information architecture that anchored our design decisions and aligned stakeholders early. From there, we iterated rapidly through collaborative workshops, shaping a structure that reflected real-world use and could scale over time.</p>

                        <strong>Systems and scale</strong>
                        <p>As the visual language evolved, the team adopted a token-based design system using Tokens
                            Studio. This allowed styles to sync directly with the development repo via GitHub,
                            streamlining updates and reducing the need for back-and-forth over visual changes. The
                            shared system gave the team flexibility to adapt quickly — including two full visual
                            refreshes — without adding delivery overhead.</p>
